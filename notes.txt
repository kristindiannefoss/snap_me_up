√ user comes to my site 

√ wants to log in

√ your site sends them to team snap to authorize,
  (when you send them to do the authorization you give a list of scopes(info types) you're asking for)
   need to send the redirect uri and client id?

√ login on teamsnap

√ teamsnap authenticates

sends the user back to the app via callback url,
  includes a bunch of query parameters that I need to use
  to identify user in the future (uid etc)
  accessible in params hash later

User's browser makes an http get request back to me

gives me a special token to tell me that the person gave me
  permission
my app needs to find out who they are,
tell teamsnap to do something on their behalf
